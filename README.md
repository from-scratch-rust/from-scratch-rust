# 🦀 from-scratch-rust


Welcome to **from-scratch-rust** — a journey into **building everything from the ground up in Rust**.  
This repo (and my broader work) is all about exploring how software really works beneath the surface — no shortcuts, no frameworks, just pure Rust 🦀.

- 🧠 **Deep dives** into language internals and memory management  
- 🧰 **Tools built from scratch** — because understanding starts at the metal

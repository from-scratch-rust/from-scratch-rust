### 🧑‍🍳 Cooking up code, one system at a time.

Welcome to **from-scratch-rust** — a journey into **building everything from the ground up in Rust**.  
This repo (and my broader work) is all about exploring how software really works beneath the surface — no shortcuts, no frameworks, just pure Rust 🦀.

### 🧱 What You’ll Find Here

- 🧩 **Low-level experiments** — filesystems, parsers, embedded code, and beyond  
- 🧠 **Deep dives** into language internals and memory management  
- 🧰 **Tools built from scratch** — because understanding starts at the metal

### 🧭 Why “From Scratch”?

Learning how systems are made *from scratch* reveals what makes them tick.  
Every crate, every function, every unsafe block teaches something new about how software becomes real.

### ⚙️ Built With

- **Rust** — memory safety, fearless concurrency  
- **Cargo** — for building and testing  
- **Makefiles** — sometimes, old school is best
